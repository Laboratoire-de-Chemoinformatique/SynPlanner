    "In retrosynthetic analysis, multiple synthetic routes can be generated for a single target molecule. Clustering these routes helps to group together pathways that share similar high-level strategies, making it easier to identify fundamentally different approaches and prioritize the most promising ones. This step enables chemists to focus on unique synthetic ideas rather than redundant variations.\n",
