    Get a 'clean' atom mapping between two molecules, avoiding conflicts.

    This function attempts to establish a mapping between the atoms of two

    The cleaning process specifically avoids adding entries to the mapping
    where the source and target indices are the same, or where the target
    index already exists as a source in the mapping with a different target.
    It also checks for potential conflicts based on the atom keys present
