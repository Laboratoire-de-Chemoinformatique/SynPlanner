============

The tutorials provide basic information on how to use SynPlanner.

We recommend that you start with `retrosynthetic planning`_,
which provides a minimal example of how to use SynPlanner for retrosynthetic planning.


The main pipeline of SynPlanner training from the raw reaction data includes:

- `Data curation`_, which presents the workflow for reaction standardization and reaction filtration.
- `Rules extraction`_, which provides a workflow for extracting rules from curated reaction data.
- `Ranking policy training`_, which shows the workflow for extracting rules from curated reaction data.
- `Value network training`_, which describe how to train a value network by simulating the tree search.

The following tutorials will be added in the next releases:

- **Comparing SynPlanner modes** will show how to modify the tree search with different networks and search strategies.
- **Filtering policy network training** will describe how to train a filtering policy from the ChEMBL data set used in the paper.
- **PARoutes benchmarking** will present an example of tree searches with SynPlanner on the PARoutes benchmarking dataset.
- **SMARTS <-> Reaction Rules Conversion with SynPlanner** will discuss how to convert reaction rules from SMARTS generated by RDChiral.
