``SynPlanner`` can be accessed by different interfaces:

- **Python interface**. Mostly used and explained in :ref:`tutorials` and :ref:`api`.
- **Command-line interface**. Each step of the ``SynPlanner`` pipeline is bound to the command in :ref:`cli`.
- **Graphical user interface**. The GUI is available as a demo version hosted on the `Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/spaces/Laboratoire-De-Chemoinformatique/SynPlanner>`_.
