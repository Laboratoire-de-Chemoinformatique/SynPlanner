The tree nodes in MCTS are expanded by an expansion function approximated by a policy graph neu-ral network.
The policy network is composed of two parts: molecular representation and reaction rule prediction parts.
In the representation part, the molecular graph is converted to a single vector by graph convolutional layers.
The training set structure and the prediction part architecture depend on the type of policy network,
particularly the ranking or filtering policy network.

**Ranking policy network**. The training dataset for ranking policy network consists of pairs of reactions and
corresponding reaction rules extracted from it. The products of the reaction are transformed to the CGR encoded
as a molecular graph with the one-hot encoded label vector where the positive label corresponds to the reaction rule.
The prediction part is terminated with the softmax function generating the “probability of successful application” of
each reaction rule to a given input molecular graph, which can be used for the reaction rules “ranking”.

**Filtering policy network**. The training dataset for the filtering policy is formed by the application of all
reaction rules to the training molecules. The labels vector is filled with positive labels in positions corresponding
to the successfully applied reaction rules. The prediction part of the filtering policy is formed from two linear layers
with a sigmoid function that assigns the probabilities for the “regular”, as well as “priority” reac-tion rules
(cyclization reaction rules). These two vectors are then combined with a coefficient α ranging from 0 to 1.
This approach ensures that the priority reaction rules receive the highest score, followed by other regular reaction rules.

**Conclusion**. The filtering policy network requires much more computational resources for the generating of the training dataset than
the ranking policy but can be used with any set of reaction rules because the original reaction dataset is not needed.
This allows for the portability of reaction rules extracted with another software from any source of reaction data.
