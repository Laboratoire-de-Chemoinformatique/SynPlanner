    Parameter                          Description
    ================================== =================================================================================
    environment_atom_count             Determines the number of layers of atoms around the reaction center to be included in the reaction rule. A value of 0 includes only the reaction center, 1 includes the first surrounding layer, and so on.
    min_popularity                     Determines the minimum number of occurrences of a reaction rule in the reaction dataset.
    multicenter_rules                  Determines whether a single rule is extracted for all centers in multicenter reactions (True) or if separate rules are generated for each center (False).
    include_rings                      Includes ring structures in the reaction rules connected to the reaction center atoms if set to True.
    include_func_groups                If True, specific functional groups are included in the reaction rule in addition to the reaction center and its environment.
    func_groups_list                   Specifies a list of functional groups to be included when include_func_groups is True.
    keep_leaving_groups                Keeps the leaving groups in the extracted reaction rule when set to True.
    keep_incoming_groups               Retains incoming groups in the extracted reaction rule if set to True.
    keep_reagents                      Includes reagents in the extracted reaction rule when True.
    atom_info_retention                Dictates the level of detail retained about atoms in the reaction center and their environment.
