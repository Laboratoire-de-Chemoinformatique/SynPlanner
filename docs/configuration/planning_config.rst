    ======================================== ==========================================================
    Parameter                                Description
    ======================================== ==========================================================
    tree:max_iterations                      The maximum number of iterations the tree search algorithm will perform
    tree:max_tree_size                       The maximum number of nodes that can be created in the search tree
    tree:max_time                            The maximum time (in seconds) for the tree search execution
    tree:max_depth                           The maximum depth of the tree, controlling how far the search can go from the root node
    tree:ucb_type                            The type of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) used in the tree search. Options include "puct" (predictive UCB), "uct" (standard UCB), and "value" (the initial node value)
    tree:backprop_type                       The backpropagation method used during the tree search. Options are "muzero" (model-based approach) and "cumulative" (cumulative reward approach)
    tree:search_strategy                     The strategy for navigating the tree. Options are "expansion_first" (prioritizing the expansion of new nodes) and "evaluation_first" (prioritizing the evaluation of existing nodes)
    tree:exclude_small                       If True, excludes small molecules from the tree, typically focusing on more complex molecules
    tree:min_mol_size                        The minimum size of a molecule (the number of heavy atoms) to be considered in the search. Molecules smaller than this threshold are typically considered readily available building blocks
    tree:init_node_value                     The initial value for newly created nodes in the tree (for expansion_first search strategy)
    tree:epsilon                             This parameter is used in the epsilon-greedy strategy during the node selection, representing the probability of choosing a random action for exploration. A higher value leads to more exploration
    tree:silent                              If True, suppresses the progress logging of the tree search
    node_evaluation:evaluation_agg           The way the evaluation scores are aggregated. Options are "max" (using the maximum score) and "average" (using the average score)
    node_evaluation:evaluation_type          The method used for node evaluation. Options include "random" (random number between 0 and 1), "rollout" (using rollout simulations), and "gcn" (graph convolutional networks)
    node_expansion:top_rules                 The maximum amount of rules to be selected for node expansion from the list of predicted reaction rules
    node_expansion:rule_prob_threshold       The reaction rules with predicted probability lower than this parameter will be discarded
    node_expansion:priority_rules_fraction   The fraction of priority rules in comparison to the regular rules (only for filtering policy)
