The SynPlanner provides 3 main interfaces:

- **Python interface**. It is documented through :ref:`tutorials` and :ref:`api`.
- **Command-line interface**. Most of functionality of SynPlanner can be run through CLI, for more information please visit
  :ref:`cli`.
- **Graphical user interface**. The GUI right now is available as a demo version hosted on
  the `Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/spaces/Laboratoire-De-Chemoinformatique/SynPlanner>`_.
